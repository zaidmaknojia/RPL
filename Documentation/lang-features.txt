This page will document the specific motivations and language features that Redaction wil jope to have.

Languages to be borrowed from:
Java, Python 2/3, Kotlin, nim..

- simple and easy to learn
	- a new programmer should be able to know all the syntax within an hour of use
	- english-like for-loops (for example)
		- "loop from 0 to last element"

- static typing and type safety (borrowing from Java and Kotlin)
	- should try to prevent null pointer exceptions
	- should stay away from python's type inference

- (probably a lot later) borrow OOP from nim/kotlin
	- 'data class' format from kotlin is nice etc
- stay away from python's dependency on tabs, everything should probably be able to mesh onto one line
- would be cool to incorporate functional programming inspired from python/haskell
