# Motivations

Here are the main reasons that Redaction was created:
- We wanted to create a language that's easy for beginners to learn and understand, and this language shares syntax that is pretty close to the C programming languages family.
- The idea of building a language from the ground up fascinated us, and we thought we should try it out based on the 2 languages we know best: Java and Python.
- Some of Java's nice features were required curly braces for functions, loops, and if statements, as well as semicolons, so we included them in Redaction.
- We liked the idea of implicit type casting in Python and Javascript, especially as manually typing out `let a = 5 type int;` is rather tiresome for such a small scripting language.
- ~~We were looking for a summer project.~~
